# ck-api

堅果中學公告擷取 API。

這個 Repo 可以大致分成三個部分：

- `main.py` – REST API。使用 `uvicorn` 和 `fastapi`。
- `discovery/*` – 資料探索。
- `ckapi/*` – 可使用的模組。

你可以下載這個 Repo，並自己試試：

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AWeirdDev/ck-api
```

```python
from ckapi import CkClient

client = CkClient()
news = await client.get_news()

print(news)
```

<details>
<summary><b>Output (obscured)</b></summary>

```python
[

        name='全部消息', 
        module_id='5abf2d62aa93092cee58ceb4',

## REST API

```

**Query parameters**:
- `n` – Optional. Number of items.
- `page` – Optional. Page #.
- `text` – Optional. Text filter.

## How?
There's this [CK app](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6608961910) made by our beloved senpai uwu (very cool)

...but bro just hasn't been updating it for over a year, and the "latest news" feature isn't working.
As a pedantic (kind of) developer myself I am NOT happy about this shi. So, I decided to make my own *fetcher* (Actually, I tried to make my own app first with Expo, but the project structure looked so hawwwd, so I'm not learning that for now).

1. We visit the [index page](https://www.ck.tp.edu.tw/nss/p/index) and iterate through the script elements to find `siteserver` (possibly the backend server). I won't be hardcoding the static URL as it might change for later versions of the site (judging by the ID, it doesn't look man-made at all).
2. We fetch the `siteserver`, and the server returns Javascript code. One line starts with `const deployMap = [`, which specifies some deployments, as far as I know.
3. We loop through the deployments to find **module IDs** and **section IDs**. Note that the term "section" is assumed, as the actual identifier is called `sid`. The same applies for `mid`.
4. We call the `/single` endpoint for individual module ID and section ID pairs, and some of them returns **class IDs** (for better message filtering).
5. With the module, section & class IDs, we can now query the messages!

It's actually possible to fetch messages without class IDs, but the output would be super messy and... unwanted! (Some are even test messages when they first published this site.)
